# ðŸ§¬ Phage Lifecycle Classification

Welcome to my data science project exploring bacteriophage life cycles using Large Language Models and machine learning. This project was part of the Phagos x AWS hackathon held on the 14th and the 15th of May 2025 (https://hackathon.phagos.org/).

## ðŸ“˜ Project Notebook

ðŸ”— [View Notebook on GitHub](./phage_lifecycle_hackthon25.ipynb)  


## ðŸ“Š Highlights

- Handling fasta files with DNA sequences.
- Used LLMs for proteins (Evolutionary Scale Modelling) to extract embeddings from amino acid sequences.
- Trained an XGBoost classifier to predict the type of lifecycle.
- Achieved ~92% model accuracy
- Visualized model performance with confusion matrices.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Biology libraries** : BioPython, Prodigal
- **Data handling and visualization** : Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Deep learning** : fair-esm
- **Machine learning** : XGBoost, scikit-learn
